Starting from this chapter, we’ll focus mainly on text generation. Generating text is often considered the holy grail of generative AI for several compelling reasons. Human language is incredibly complex and nuanced. It involves not only understanding grammar and vocabulary but also context, tone, and cultural references. Successfully generating coherent and contextually appropriate text is a significant challenge that requires deep understanding and processing of language. \n\nAs humans, we primarily communicate through language. AI that can generate human-like text can interact more naturally with users, making technology more accessible and user-friendly. Text generation has many applications, from automating customer service responses to creating entire articles, scripting for games and movies, aiding in creative writing, and even building personal assistants. The potential impact across industries is enormous.\n\nIn this chapter, we’ll make our first attempt at building and training models to generate text. You’ll learn to tackle three main challenges in modeling text generation. First, text is sequential data, consisting of data points organized in a specific sequence, where each point is successively ordered to reflect the inherent order and interdependencies within the data. Predicting outcomes for sequences is challenging due to their sensitive ordering. Altering the sequence of elements changes their meaning. Secondly, text exhibits long-range dependencies: the meaning of a certain part of the text depends on elements that appeared much earlier in the text (e.g., 200 words ago). Understanding and modeling these long-range dependencies is essential for generating coherent text. Lastly, human language is ambiguous and context dependent. Training a model to understand nuances, sarcasm, idioms, and cultural references to generate contextually accurate text is challenging.\n\nYou'll explore a specific neural network designed for handling sequential data, such as text or time series: the recurrent neural network (RNN). Traditional neural networks, such as feedforward neural networks or fully connected networks, treat each input independently. This means that the network processes each input separately, without considering any relationship or order between different inputs. In contrast, RNNs are specifically designed to handle sequential data. In an RNN, the output at a given time step depends not only on the current input but also on previous inputs. This allows RNNs to maintain a form of memory, capturing information from previous time steps to influence the processing of the current input. \nThis sequential processing makes RNNs suitable for tasks where the order of the inputs matters, such as language modeling, where the goal is to predict the next word in a sentence based on previous words. We’ll focus on one variant of RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which can recognize both short-term and long-term data patterns in sequential data like text. LSTM models use a hidden state to capture information in previous time steps. Therefore, a trained LSTM model can produce coherent text based on the context. \n\nThe style of the generated text depends on the training data. Additionally, as we plan to train a model from scratch for text generation, text length is a crucial factor. It needs to be sufficiently extensive for the model to effectively learn and mimic a particular writing style, yet concise enough to avoid excessive computational demands during training. As a result, we’ll use the text from the novel Anna Karenina to train an LSTM model. Since neural networks like an LSTM cannot accept text as input directly, you’ll learn to break down text into tokens (individual words in this chapter; but can be parts of words, as you’ll see in later chapters), a process known as tokenization. You’ll then create a dictionary to map each unique token into an integer (i.e., an index). Based on this dictionary, you’ll convert the text into a long sequence of integers, ready to be fed into a neural network. \n\nYou’ll use sequences of indexes of a certain length as the input to train the LSTM model. You shift the sequence of inputs by one token to the right and use it as the output: you are effectively training the model to predict the next word in a sentence. This is the so-called sequence-to-sequence prediction problem in natural language processing (NLP) and you’ll see it again in later chapters. \n\nOnce the LSTM is trained, you’ll use it to generate text one token at a time based on previous tokens in the sequence as follows: You feed a prompt (part of a sentence such as “Anna and the”) to the trained model. The model then predicts the most likely next token and appends the selected token to your prompt. The updated prompt serves again as the input and the model is used once more to predict the next token. The iterative process continues until the prompt reaches a certain length. This approach is similar to the mechanism employed by more advanced generative models like ChatGPT (though ChatGPT is not an LSTM). You’ll witness the trained LSTM model generating grammatically correct and coherent text, with a style matching that of the original novel. \n\nFinally, you also learn how to control the creativeness of the generated text by using temperature and top-K sampling. Temperature controls the randomness of the predictions of the trained model. A high temperature makes the generated text more creative while a low temperature makes the text more confident and predictable. Top-K sampling is a method where you select the next token from the top K most probable tokens, rather than selecting from the entire vocabulary. A small value of K leads to the selection of highly likely tokens in each step and this, in turn, makes the generated text less creative and more coherent.\nThe primary goal of this chapter is not necessarily to generate the most coherent text possible, which, as mentioned earlier, presents substantial challenges. Instead, our objective is to demonstrate the limitations of RNNs, thereby setting the stage for the introduction of Transformers in subsequent chapters. More importantly, this chapter establishes the basic principles of text generation, including tokenization, word embedding, sequence prediction, temperature settings, and top-K sampling. Consequently, in the later chapters, you will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of NLP. This foundation will allow us to concentrate on other, more advanced, aspects of NLP, such as how the attention mechanism functions and the architecture of Transformers.","metadata":{}},{"id":"30d1c19a","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
